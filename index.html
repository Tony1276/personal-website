                <!-- Notes
                     the <em> tag is the emphasise tag.
                     This Italisise the texts what it wraps around.
                     However the <i> tag also does the same functionality.
                     So why not use <i>??
                     This is because the <em> tag tells the browser that the text that is wrapped is stressed. This convey meaning.
                     But the <i> tag only styles the text and does not convey any meaning.
                     It is good practice to always use <em> because it conveys meaning.
                     When we write HTML code, we care more about the structure of the content rather than how they look.

                     Another similar pair is the <b> tag which makes the target text bold.
                     But instead, you should be using the <strong> tag because it conveys meaning which tells the browser that is of strong importance.

                             This is achieved through the <a> tag.
                             The <a> tag which refers to the anchor tag consists of:
                             The <a> element
                             The href attribute which contains the link destination
                             The closing tag (not a self closing tag)
