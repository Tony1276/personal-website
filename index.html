        the <em> tag is the emphasise tag.
         This Italisise the texts what it wraps around.
         However the <i> tag also does the same functionality.
         So why not use <i>??
         This is because the <em> tag tells the browser that the text that is wrapped is stressed. This convey meaning.
         But the <i> tag only styles the text and does not convey any meaning.
         It is good practice to always use <em> because it conveys meaning.
         When we write HTML code, we care more about the structure of the content rather than how they look.

         Another similar pair is the <b> tag which makes the target text bold.
         But instead, you should be using the <strong> tag because it conveys meaning which tells the browser that is of strong importance.
